Question 19 - Spectral Analysis 

If a scientist knows the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave, he or she can deter-mine what type of radiation it is. Write a program that asks for the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave in meters and then displays what that wave is according to the chart below. (For example, a wave with a wavelength of 1E-10 meters would be an X-ray.)

	1 * 10^-2	1 * 10^-3	7 * 10^-7	4 * 10^-7	1 * 10^-8	1 * 10^-11
