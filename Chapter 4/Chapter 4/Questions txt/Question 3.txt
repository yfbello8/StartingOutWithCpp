Question 3 - Magic Dates 

The date June 10, 1960 is special because when we write it in the following format, the month times the day equals the year. 

6/10/60 

Write a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day, and a two-digit year. The program should then determine whether the month times the day is equal to the year. If so, it should display a message saying the date is magic. Otherwise it should display a message saying the date is not magic.
