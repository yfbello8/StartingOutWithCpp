Question 18 - Fat Gram Calculator 

Write a program that asks for the number of calories and fat grams in a food. The pro-gram should display the percentage of calories that come from fat. If the calories from fat are less than 30% of the total calories of the food, it should also display a message indicating that the food is low in fat. 

One gram of fat has 9 calories, so 
Calories from fat = fat grams * 9 
The percentage of calories from fat can be calculated as 
Calories from fat / total calories 
Input  Validation:  Make  sure  the  number  of  calories  and  fat  grams  are  not  less  than  0.  Also,  the  number  of  calories  from  fat  cannot  be  greater  than  the  total  number  of  calories. If that happens, display an error message indicating that either the calories or fat grams were incorrectly entered.
