Question 8 - Color Mixer 

The colors red, blue, and yellow are known as the primary colors because they cannot be made by mixing other colors. When you mix two primary colors, you get a second-ary color, as shown here: 

When you mix red and blue, you get purple. 
When you mix red and yellow, you get orange. 
When you mix blue and yellow, you get green. 

Write  a  program  that  prompts  the  user  to  enter  the  names  of  two  primary  colors  to  mix.  If  the  user  enters  anything  other  than  “red,”  “blue,”  or  “yellow,”  the  program  should display an error message. Otherwise, the program should display the name of the secondary color that results by mixing two primary colors.
