Question 20 - The Speed of Sound 

The following table shows the approximate speed of sound in air, water, and steel. 

Medium			Speed 
Air			1,100 feet per second 
Water			4,900 feet per second 
Steel			16,400 feet per second 

Write a program that displays a menu allowing the user to select air, water, or steel. After the user has made a selection, he or she should be asked to enter the distance a sound wave will travel in the selected medium. The program will then display the amount of time it will take. (Round the answer to four decimal places.) 
Input Validation: Check that the user has selected one of the available choices from the menu. Do not accept distances less than 0.
