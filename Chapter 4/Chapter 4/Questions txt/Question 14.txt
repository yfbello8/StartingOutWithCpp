Question 14 - Bank Charges 

A bank charges $10 per month plus the following check fees for a commercial check-ing account: 

$.10 each for fewer than 20 checks 
$.08 each for 20–39 checks 
$.06 each for 40–59 checks 
$.04 each for 60 or more checks 

The bank also charges an extra $15 if the balance of the account falls below $400 (before any check fees are applied). Write a program that asks for the beginning balance and the number of checks written. Compute and display the bank’s service fees for the month. 
Input Validation: Do not accept a negative value for the number of checks written. If a negative value is given for the beginning balance, display an urgent message indicating the account is overdrawn.
