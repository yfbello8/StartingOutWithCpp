Question 10 - Days in a Month 

Write a program that asks the user to enter the month (letting the user enter an inte-ger in the range of 1 through 12) and the year. The program should then display the number of days in that month. Use the following criteria to identify leap years: 

1. Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year but 2100 is not. 
2. If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and if only it is divisible by 4. For example, 2008 is a leap year but 2009 is not.  

Here is a sample run of the program: 
Enter a month (1-12):  2 [Enter] 
Enter a year:  2008 [Enter] 
29 days
