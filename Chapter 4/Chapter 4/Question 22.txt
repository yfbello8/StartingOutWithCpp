Question 22 - Freezing and Boiling Points 

The following table lists the freezing and boiling points of several substances. Write a program  that  asks  the  user  to  enter  a  temperature  and  then  shows  all  the  substances  that will freeze at that temperature and all that will boil at that temperature. For exam-ple, if the user enters −20 the program should report that water will freeze and oxygen will boil at that temperature. 

Substance		Freezing Point (°F)		Boiling Point (°F) 
Ethyl alcohol		-173				172 
Mercury			-38				676 
Oxygen			-362				-306 
Water			32				212
