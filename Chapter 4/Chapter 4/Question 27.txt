You  can  calculate  the  number  of  minutes  in  a  month  by  multiplying  its  number  of  hours  by  60.  Enhance  the  input  validation  of  the Mobile Service Provider program by asking the user for the month (by name), and validating that the number of minutes entered is not more than the maximum for the entire month.
