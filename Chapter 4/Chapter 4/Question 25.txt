Question 25 - Mobile Service Provider

Package A: For $39.99 per month 450 minutes are provided. Additional minutes are $0.45 per minute. 
Package B: For $59.99 per month 900 minutes are provided. Additional minutes are $0.40 per minute. 
Package C: For $69.99 per month unlimited minutes provided. 

Write a program that calculates a customer's monthly bill. It should ask which package the customer has purchased and how many minutes were used. It should then display the total amount due.
