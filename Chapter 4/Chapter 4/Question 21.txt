Question 21 - The Speed of Sound in Gases 

When  sound  travels  through  a  gas,  its  speed  depends  primarily  on  the  density  of  the  medium. The less dense the medium, the faster the speed will be. The following table shows the approximate speed of sound at 0 degrees centigrade, measured in meters per second, when traveling through carbon dioxide, air, helium, and hydrogen.
 
Medium			Speed (Meters per Second) 
Carbon Dioxide		258.0 
Air			331.5 
Helium			972.0 
Hydrogen		1,270.0 

Write  a  program  that  displays  a  menu  allowing  the  user  to  select  one  of  these  four  gases. After a selection has been made, the user should enter the number of seconds it took for the sound to travel in this medium from its source to the location at which it was detected. The program should then report how far away (in meters) the source of the sound was from the detection location. 
Input Validation: Check that the user has selected one of the available menu choices. Do not accept times less than 0 seconds or more than 30 seconds.
