Question 1 - Charge Account Validation 

Write a program that lets the user enter a charge account number. The program should determine if the number is valid by checking for it in the following list: 
 
5658845		4520125		7895122		8777541		8451277		1302850		8080152		456255		5552012		5050552		7825877		1250255		100523		6545231		3852085		7576651		7881200		4581002 
 
The list of numbers above should be initialized in a single-dimensional array. A simple linear search should be used to locate the number entered by the user. If the user enters a number that is in the array, the program should display a message saying that the number is valid. If the user enters a number that is not in the array, the program should display a message indicating that the number is invalid.
