Question 10 - Sorting Orders
 
Write a program that uses two identical arrays of just eight integers. It should display the contents of the first array, then call a function to sort the array using an ascending order bubble sort modified to print out the array contents after each pass of the sort. Next, the program should display the contents of the second array, then call a function to sort the array using an ascending order selection sort modified to print out the array contents after each pass of the sort.
