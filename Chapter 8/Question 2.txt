Question 2 - Lottery Winners 

A lottery ticket buyer purchases 10 tickets a week, always playing the same 10 5-digit “lucky” combinations. Write a program that initializes an array or a vector with these numbers and then lets the player enter this week’s winning 5-digit number. The program should perform a linear search through the list of the player’s numbers and report whether or not one of the tickets is a winner this week. Here are the numbers: 
 
13579		26791		26792		33445		55555		62483		77777		79422		85647		93121
