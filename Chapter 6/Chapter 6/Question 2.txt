Question 2 - Rectangle Areaâ€”Complete the Program 

If you have downloaded this book's source code from the companion Web site, you will find a partially written program named AreaRectangle.cpp in the  Chapter  06 folder. (The companion Web site is at www.pearsonhighered.com/gaddis) Your job is to complete the program. When it is complete, the program will ask the user to enter the width and length of a rectangle and then display the rectangle's area. The program calls the following functions, which have not been written:

- getLength - This function should ask the user to enter the rectangle's length and then return that value as a double. 
- getWidth - This function should ask the user to enter the rectangle's width and then return that value as a double. 
- getArea - This function should accept the rectangle's length and width as argu-ments and return the rectangle's area. The area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. 
- displayData - This function should accept the rectangle's length, width, and area as arguments and display them in an appropriate message on the screen.
