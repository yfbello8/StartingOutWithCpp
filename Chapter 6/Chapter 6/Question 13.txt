Question 13 - Days Out 

Write a program that calculates the average number of days a company's employees are absent. The program should have the following functions: 

- A function called by main that asks the user for the number of employees in the company. This value should be returned as an int. (The function accepts no arguments.) 
- A function called by main that accepts one argument: the number of employees in the company. The function should ask the user to enter the number of days each employee missed during the past year. The total of these days should be returned as an int. 
- A function called by main that takes two arguments: the number of employees in the company and the total number of days absent for all employees during the year. The function should return, as a double, the average number of days absent. (This function does not perform screen output and does not ask the user for input.) 
Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of employees. Do not accept a negative number for the days any employee missed.
