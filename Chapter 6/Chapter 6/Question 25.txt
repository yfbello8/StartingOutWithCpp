Question 25 - Travel Expenses 

This program should be designed and written by a team of students. Here are some suggestions: 

- One student should design function main, which will call the other functions in the pro-gram. The remainder of the functions will be designed by other members of the team. 
- The requirements of the program should be analyzed so each student is given about the same workload. 
- The parameters and return types of each function should be decided in advance. 
- Stubs and drivers should be used to test and debug the program. 
- The program can be implemented as a multifile program, or all the functions can be cut and pasted into the main file. 

Here is the assignment: Write a program that calculates and displays the total travel expenses of a businessperson on a trip. The program should have functions that ask for and return the following: 

- The total number of days spent on the trip 
- The time of departure on the first day of the trip, and the time of arrival back home on the last day of the trip 
- The amount of any round-trip airfare 
- The amount of any car rentals 
- Miles driven, if a private vehicle was used. Calculate the vehicle expense as $0.27 per mile driven 
- Parking fees (The company allows up to $6 per day. Anything in excess of this must be paid by the employee.) 
- Taxi fees, if a taxi was used anytime during the trip (The company allows up to $10 per day, for each day a taxi was used. Anything in excess of this must be paid by the employee.) 
- Conference or seminar registration fees â€¢  Hotel expenses (The company allows up to $90 per night for lodging. Anything in excess of this must be paid by the employee.) 
- The amount of each meal eaten. On the first day of the trip, breakfast is allowed as an expense if the time of departure is before 7 a.m. Lunch is allowed if the time of departure is before 12 noon. Dinner is allowed on the first day if the time of departure is before 6 p.m. On the last day of the trip, breakfast is allowed if the time of arrival is after 8 a.m. Lunch is allowed if the time of arrival is after 1 p.m. Dinner is allowed on the last day if the time of arrival is after 7 p.m. The program should only ask for the amounts of allowable meals. (The company allows up to $9 for breakfast, $12 for lunch, and $16 for dinner. Anything in excess of this must be paid by the employee.) 

The program should calculate and display the total expenses incurred by the busi-nessperson, the total allowable expenses for the trip, the excess that must be reim-bursed by the businessperson, if any, and the amount saved by the businessperson if the expenses were under the total allowed. 
Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for any dollar amount or for miles driven in a private vehicle. Do not accept numbers less than 1 for the number of days. Only accept valid times for the time of departure and the time of arrival.
