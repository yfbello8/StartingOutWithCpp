Question 7 - Celsius Temperature Table 

The formula for converting a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius is 

C = 5/9(F-32) 

where F is the Fahrenheit temperature and C is the Celsius temperature. Write a func-tion named celsius that accepts a Fahrenheit temperature as an argument. The func-tion should return the temperature, converted to Celsius. Demonstrate the function by calling it in a loop that displays a table of the Fahrenheit temperatures 0 through 20 and their Celsius equivalents.
