Question 18 - Paint Job Estimator 

A painting company has determined that for every 110 square feet of wall space, one gallon of paint and eight hours of labor will be required. The company charges $25.00 per hour for labor. Write a modular program that allows the user to enter the number of rooms that are to be painted and the price of the paint per gallon. It should also ask for the square feet of wall space in each room. It should then display the following data: 

- The number of gallons of paint required 
- The hours of labor required 
- The cost of the paint 
- The labor charges 
- The total cost of the paint job 

Input validation: Do not accept a value less than 1 for the number of rooms. Do not accept a value less than $10.00 for the price of paint. Do not accept a negative value for square footage of wall space.
