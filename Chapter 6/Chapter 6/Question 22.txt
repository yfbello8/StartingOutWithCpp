Question 22 - isPrime Function 

A prime number is a number that is only evenly divisible by itself and 1. For example, the number 5 is prime because it can only be evenly divided by 1 and 5. The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, and 6. 

Write a function name isPrime, which takes an integer as an argument and returns true if the argument is a prime number, or false otherwise. Demonstrate the function in a complete program. 

TIP: Recall that the % operator divides one number by another, and returns the remainder of the division. In an expression such as num1 % num2, the % operator will return 0 if num1 is evenly divisible by num2.
