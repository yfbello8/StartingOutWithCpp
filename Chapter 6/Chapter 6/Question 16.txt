Question 16 - Population 

In a population, the birth rate is the percentage increase of the population due to births, and the death rate is the percentage decrease of the population due to deaths. Write a program that displays the size of a population for any number of years. The program should ask for the following data: 

- The starting size of a population 
- The annual birth rate 
- The annual death rate 
- The number of years to display 

Write a function that calculates the size of the population for a year. The formula is 

N = P + BP âˆ’ DP 

where N is the new population size, P is the previous population size, B is the birth rate, and D is the death rate. 
Input Validation: Do not accept numbers less than 2 for the starting size. Do not accept negative numbers for birth rate or death rate. Do not accept numbers less than 1 for the number of years.
