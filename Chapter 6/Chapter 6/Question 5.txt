Question 5 - Falling Distance

When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period: 
d = 1/2*gt^t

The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and tis the amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling. Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an object's falling time (in seconds) as an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that time interval. Write a program that demonstrates the function by calling it in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as arguments and displays the return value.
