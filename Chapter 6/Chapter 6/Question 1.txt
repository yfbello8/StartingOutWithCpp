Question 1 - Markup 

Write a program that asks the user to enter an item's wholesale cost and its markup percentage. It should then display the item's retail price. For example:

- If  an  item's  wholesale  cost  is  5.00  and  its  markup  percentage  is  100%,  then  the  itemâ€™s retail price is 10.00
- If an item's wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 50%, then the item's retail price is 7.50. 

The program should have a function named calculateRetail that receives the wholesale cost and the markup percentage as arguments and returns the retail price of the item. 
Input Validation: Do not accept negative values for either the wholesale cost of the item or the markup percentage.
