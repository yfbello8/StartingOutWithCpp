Question 8 - Coin Toss 

Write a function named coinToss that simulates the tossing of a coin. When you call the function, it should generate a random number in the range of 1 through 2. If the random number is 1, the function should display "heads." If the random number is 2, the function should display "tails." Demonstrate the function in a program that asks the user how many times the coin should be tossed and then simulates the tossing of the coin that number of times.
