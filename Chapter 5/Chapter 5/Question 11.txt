Question 11 - Population 

Write a program that will predict the size of a population of organisms. The program should ask the user for the starting number of organisms, their average daily popula-tion increase (as a percentage), and the number of days they will multiply. A loop should display the size of the population for each day. 
Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 2 for the starting size of the popu-lation. Do not accept a negative number for average daily population increase. Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of days they will multiply.
