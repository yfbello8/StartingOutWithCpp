Question 6 - Distance Traveled 

The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows: 

distance = speed * time 

For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for 3 hours, the distance traveled is 120 miles. 
Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and how many hours it has traveled. The program should then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period. Here is an example of the output: 

What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 40 
How many hours has it traveled? 3 
Hour		Distance Traveled 
-------------------------------- 
1		40 
2		80 
3		120 
Input Validation: Do not accept a negative number for speed and do not accept any value less than 1 for time traveled.
