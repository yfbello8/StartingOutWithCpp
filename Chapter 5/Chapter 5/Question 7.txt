Question 7 - Pennies for Pay 

Write a program that calculates how much a person would earn over a period of time if his or her salary is one penny the first day and two pennies the second day, and con-tinues to double each day. The program should ask the user for the number of days. Display a table showing how much the salary was for each day, and then show the total pay at the end of the period. The output should be displayed in a dollar amount, not the number of pennies. Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of days worked.
