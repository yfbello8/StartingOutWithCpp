Question 16 - Savings Account Balance 

Write a program that calculates the balance of a savings account at the end of a period of time. It should ask the user for the annual interest rate, the starting balance, and the number of months that have passed since the account was established. A loop should then iterate once for every month, performing the following: 

A) Ask the user for the amount deposited into the account during the month. (Do not accept negative numbers.) This amount should 	be added to the balance. 
B) Ask the user for the amount withdrawn from the account during the month. (Do not accept negative numbers.) This amount should 	be subtracted from the balance. 
C) Calculate the monthly interest. The monthly interest rate is the annual interest rate divided by twelve. Multiply the monthly 	interest rate by the balance, and add the result to the balance. 

After the last iteration, the program should display the ending balance, the total amount of deposits, the total amount of withdrawals, and the total interest earned. 
NOTE: If a negative balance is calculated at any point, a message should be displayed indicating the account has been closed and the loop should terminate.
