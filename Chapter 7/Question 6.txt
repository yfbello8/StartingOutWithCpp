Question 6 - Rain or Shine 
 
An amateur meteorologist wants to keep track of weather conditions during the past year's three-month summer season and has designated each day as either rainy ('R'), cloudy ('C'), or sunny ('S'). Write a program that stores this information in a 3 Ã— 30 array of characters, where the row indicates the month (0 = June, 1 = July, 2 = August) and the column indicates the day of the month. Note that data are not being collected for the 31st of any month. The program should begin by reading the weather data in from a file. Then it should create a report that displays, for each month and for the whole three-month period, how many days were rainy, how many were cloudy, and how many were sunny. It should also report which of the three months had the largest number of rainy days. Data for the program can be found in 
the RainOrShine.txt file.
