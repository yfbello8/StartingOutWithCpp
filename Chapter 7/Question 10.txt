Question 10 - Driver's License Exam 
 
 The local Driver's License Office has asked you to write a program that grades the writ-
ten portion of the driver's license exam. The exam has 20 multiple choice questions. 
Here are the correct answers: 

1. A		2. D		3. B		4. B		5. C		6. B		7. A		8. B		9. C		10. D		11. A		12. C		13. D		14. B		15. D		16. C		17. C		18. A		19. D		20. B 

Your program should store the correct answers shown above in an array. It should ask 
the user to enter the student's answers for each of the 20 questions, and the answers 
should be stored in another array. After the student's answers have been entered, the 
program should display a message indicating whether the student passed or failed the 
exam. (A student must correctly answer 15 of the 20 questions to pass the exam.) It 
should then display the total number of correctly answered questions, the total number 
of incorrectly answered questions, and a list showing the question numbers of the 
incorrectly answered questions. 
Input Validation: Only accept the letters A, B, C, or D as answers.
