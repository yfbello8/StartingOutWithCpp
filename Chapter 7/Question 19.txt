Question 19 - 2D Array Operations 
 
Write a program that creates a two-dimensional array initialized with test data. Use any data type you wish. The program should have the following functions: 
 
- getTotal. This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its argument and return the total of all the values in the array. 
- getAverage. This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its argument and return the average of all the values in the array. 
- getRowTotal. This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. The function should return the total of the values in the specified row. 
- getColumnTotal . This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a column in the array. The function should return the total of the values in the specified column. 
- getHighestInRow. This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. The function should return the highest value in the specified row of the array. 
- getLowestInRow. This function should accept a two-dimensional array as its first argument and an integer as its second argument. The second argument should be the subscript of a row in the array. The function should return the lowest value in the specified row of the array. 
 
Demonstrate each of the functions in this program.
