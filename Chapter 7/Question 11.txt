Question 11 - Exam Grader 
 
One of your professors has asked you to write a program to grade her final exams, which consist of only 20 multiple-choice questions. Each question has one of four pos-sible answers: A, B, C, or D. The file CorrectAnswers.txt contains the correct answers for all of the questions, with each answer written on a separate line. The first line contains the answer to the first question, the second line contains the answer to the second question, and so forth. (Download the book's source code from the companion Web site at www.pearsonhighered.com/gaddis. You will find the file in the Chapter 07 folder.) 
Write a program that reads the contents of the  CorrectAnswers.txt  file into a  char array, and then reads the contents of another file, containing a student's answers, into a second char array. (You can use the file StudentAnswers.txt for testing purposes. This file is also in the  Chapter 07 source code folder, available on the book's companion Web site.) The program should determine the number of questions that the student missed and then display the following: 
 
- A list of the questions missed by the student, showing the correct answer and the incorrect answer provided by the student for each missed question 
- The total number of questions missed 
- The percentage of questions answered correctly. This can be calculated as 

Correctly Answered Questions / Total Number of Questions 

- If the percentage of correctly answered questions is 70% or greater, the program should indicate that the student passed the exam. Otherwise, it should indicate that the student failed the exam.
