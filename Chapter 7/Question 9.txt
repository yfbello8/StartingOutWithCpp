Question 9 - Payroll 
 
Write a program that uses the following arrays: 
 
- empId: an array of seven long integers to hold employee identification numbers. The array should be initialized with the following numbers: 
 
5658845		4520125		7895122		8777541		8451277		1302850		7580489 

- hours: an array of seven integers to hold the number of hours worked by each employee 
- payRate: an array of seven doubles to hold each employee's hourly pay rate 
- wages: an array of seven double s to hold each employee's gross wages 
 
The program should relate the data in each array through the subscripts. For example, the number in element 0 of the hours array should be the number of hours worked by the employee whose identification number is stored in element 0 of the empId array. That same employee's pay rate should be stored in element 0 of the payRate array. The program should display each employee number and ask the user to enter that employee's hours and pay rate. It should then calculate the gross wages for that employee (hours times pay rate) and store them in the wages array. After the data has been entered for all the employees, the program should display each employee's identification number and gross wages. 
Input Validation: Do not accept negative values for hours or numbers less than 15.00 
for pay rate.
