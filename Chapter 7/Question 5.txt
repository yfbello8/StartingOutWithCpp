Question 5 - Monkey Business 
 
A local zoo wants to keep track of how many pounds of food each of its three monkeys eats each day during a typical week. Write a program that stores this information in a two-dimensional 3 x 5 array, where each row represents a different monkey and each column represents a different day of the week. The program should first have the user input the data for each monkey. Then it should create a report that includes the following information: 

- Average amount of food eaten per day by the whole family of monkeys.   
- The least amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey.   
- The greatest amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey. 

Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for pounds of food eaten.
