Question 17 - Name Search 
 
If you have downloaded this book’s source code from the companion Web site, you will find the following files in this chapter’s folder: 
 
- GirlNames.txt—This file contains a list of the 200 most popular names given to girls born in the United States from 2000 to 2009. 
- BoyNames.txt—This file contains a list of the 200 most popular names given to boys born in the United States from 2000 to 2009. 
 
Write a program that reads the contents of the two files into two separate arrays or vectors. The user should be able to enter a boy’s name, a girl’s name, or both, and the application should display messages indicating whether the names were among the most popular.
