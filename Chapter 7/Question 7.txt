- The lowest number in the array 
- The highest number in the array  
- The total of the numbers in the array 
- The average of the numbers in the array 
 
If you have downloaded this bookâ€™s source code from the companion Web site, you will find a file named numbers.txt in the  Chapter 07 
folder. You can use the file to 
test the program. (The companion Web site is at www.pearsonhighered.com/gaddis.)
